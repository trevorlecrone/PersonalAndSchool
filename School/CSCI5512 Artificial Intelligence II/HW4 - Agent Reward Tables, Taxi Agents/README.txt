Write Agents for [OpenAI's Gymnasium Taxi environment](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/taxi/)
Also write agents that compete against each other and build out reward tables for different games

All three solution .py files can be run as specified in the write up as long as required packages are installed, pyPlot is needed for the graphs,
all other imports other than gymnasium are standard python imports and shouldn't require a pip install
