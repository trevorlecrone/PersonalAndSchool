# C++ Collision Detection library
Collision detection library that had to meet performance benchmarks and be used for the next class project, a pinball game. Includes a suite of tests I used to validate correctness. Task files were used to benchmark performance. They output the number of total unique collisions and "first" object ID of each collision. No real visual component to this

Should build with provided VisualStudio files in VisualStudio 2022.

Could be improved with a bounding volume hierarchy or similar optimization structure, but exceeded benchmarks required for course.
