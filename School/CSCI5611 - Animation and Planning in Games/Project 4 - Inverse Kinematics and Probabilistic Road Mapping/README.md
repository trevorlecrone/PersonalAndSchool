# Inverse kinematics and Probabilistic Road Mapping
Ineteractive inverse kinematic skeleton and probabilistic road mapping somulations. inverse kinematics sim has different modes that can be toggled, and the skeleton tries to reach the red ball without colliding with the blue balls.

Probabilistic road map agent will generate a path to the goal (red cylinder) and avoid the sperical and rectangular obsticles. Agent will smooth its path by advancing towards the furthest possible node it has a clear path to, or directly to the goal once a clear path is available
