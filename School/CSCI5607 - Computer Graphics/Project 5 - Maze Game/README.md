# C++ Maze game from scratch
A very simple game where you navigate mazes and grab keys to move blocks. Used as an exercise for GPU shaders (edge, vertex and texture shaders), model re-use, and interactivity. Key and goal models are my own. Levels are generated by parsing text docs and placing models and determining collisions based on the level file.

Improvements I plan to make (in addition to general code cleanup) include fixing key inventory rotation behavior, getting stuck in walls when moving too fast due to high frame rate, and decoupling the physics tick rate and rendering frame rate

Should build with provided VisualStudio files in VisualStudio 2022. Contents of RequiredResources directory need to be in the folder the executable is in

Here are a few sample screenshots

Different color "doors" block the player's path

Keys are found that raise doors up
