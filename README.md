# PersonalAndSchool
Personal and academic projects of mine.

Academic projects may contain some sample or example code provided by instructors, but with credit and acknowledgement to the provider(s) of the code.
The bulk of all academic projects is still my own code. They will be left in the state they were when originally turned in, and improvemnts or cleanup I do will be in a corresponding project in personal.
