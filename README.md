# PersonalAndSchool
Personal and academic projects of mine.

Academic projects may contain some sample or example code provided by instructors, but with credit and acknowledgement to the provider(s) of the code.
The bulk of all academic projects is still my own code. They will be left in the state they were when originally turned in, with minor changes to get the project building in visual studio 2022 rather than 2017. They may be in need of some cleanup or speedup that I was
not able to get to when I originally tuend them in but any improvements or cleanup I do will be in a corresponding project in personal.
